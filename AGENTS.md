## Test important roles
- add prefix `ai` for each unit test
- if it's the test for java, every test must contain `@DisplayName` annotation with human-readable name
- if it's the test for java, never use lenient() for stubbing, try to remove not required stubbing instead of using lenient()
- if it's the test for java, use `Mockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions(mock)` in the `@AfterEach` method to verify that no more interactions with the mock happened

## TypeScript Development Standards

### Type Safety
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Implement proper generic constraints
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` for dynamic content

### Code Structure
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
- Use composition over inheritance

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Implement integration tests for API interactions
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

See [project architecture](../context/architecture.context.md) for detailed patterns.

## Testing Best Practices

### Test Structure
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Keep tests focused on a single concern
- Group related tests using nested describe blocks

### Test Quality
- Write tests that are independent and can run in any order
- Use appropriate assertions that provide clear failure messages
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Avoid testing implementation details

### Coverage and Performance
- Aim for high test coverage but focus on meaningful tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Write fast-running unit tests
- Use integration tests sparingly for critical paths

### Test Data
- Use factories or builders for creating test data
- Keep test data minimal and relevant
- Use realistic but safe test data
- Clean up test data after each test

See [project architecture](../context/architecture.context.md) for testing patterns.
